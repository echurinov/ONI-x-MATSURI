PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

ONI x MATSURI is a side-scrolling platformer where the main player must

least one instance of much of the core functionality. This includes:
- Entity and component system
- Sprite rendering and basic animation
- Scene switching (Start, Game, and Game Over screens)
- Player Controller
- Taking and dealing damage
- A level component builder (to be utilized in procedural generation)
- Enemy system
