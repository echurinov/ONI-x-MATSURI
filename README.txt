PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

ONI x MATSURI is a side-scrolling platformer where the main player must
fight and progress through a Japanese summer festival invaded by Oni.
In this prototype, most of the back-end has been implemented with at
least one instance of much of the core functionality. This includes:
- Entity and component system
- Sprite rendering and basic animation
- Scene switching (Start, Game, and Game Over screens)
- Player Controller
- Taking and dealing damage
- A level component builder (to be utilized in procedural generation)
- Enemy system
- Physics System
